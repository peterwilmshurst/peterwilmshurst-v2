## Project Init

A handy gulp project starter template. Including:

*   Browser synchronisation
*   Html minification
*   Sass to CSS compiler
*   Autoprefixer (two previous browser versions)
*   Sourcemaps
*   Uglify code formatting
*   Bootstrap 4
*   FTP from the command line

**Please Note:** Currently this requires node version 8.11.4 and gulp version 3.9.1\. Use [NVM](http://nvm.sh) to switch between node versions (see previous post). Rewriting the gulp file to work with later versions of node/gulp is on my list.
