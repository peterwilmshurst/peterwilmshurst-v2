## Node Version Manager

NVM is a local development game changer.

### What Is It?

Node Version Manager is exactly what its name says: a simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions.

While it doesn’t sound complicated, what NVM can do is awesome. It makes it possible to:

*   Access every long term support (LTS) version of Node.js from v0.1.14 to the latest version today.
*   Download any one of those remote LTS versions of Node locally with a simple command,
*   Set up aliases to switch between different downloaded versions of Node with ease,
*   Default to automatically use whichever version of Node.js is specified if a .nvmrc file is present in a repo,
*   And it works with multiple types of shells: Sh, Bash, Zsh, Dash, Ksh, (not Fish though).
*   As long as you’re fairly comfortable with the command line, you can use NVM.
