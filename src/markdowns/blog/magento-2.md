## Magento 2

For the last month I have immersed myself in Magento development. Installing an open source development environment as well as installing and syncing a cloud version on my PC and Mac. I have installed Magento in each case using [](https://getcomposer.org/)Composer. Using Composer to get the Magento software metapackage provides the following advantages:

*   Reuse third-party libraries without bundling them with source code
*   Reduce extension conflicts and compatibility issues by using a component-based architecture with robust dependency management
*   Adhere to PHP-Framework Interoperability Group (FIG) standards
*   Repackage Magento Open Source with other components
*   Use the Magento software in a production environment

I have been experimenting with customisation and child themes, so far so good!
