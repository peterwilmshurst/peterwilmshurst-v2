## Netlify

I feel like I am a little late to the party. I have discovered [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and am now hosting my website here.

Very simple to setup, lots of documentation. In a nutshell:

1.  Create a new site
2.  Link and authorise your GitHub account
3.  Select your repository
4.  Configure your settings (add build commands etc.)
5.  Build your site
6.  All done

Still getting my head around it but it already feels like I should have discovered this sooner! There is also a useful webform service which I plan on looking at in more detail soon.
