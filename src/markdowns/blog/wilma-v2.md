# Wilma v2.0
#### 01st April, 2021

I've given my website a bit of a revamp. Not only have I finally added some content (more to come!) I've rebuilt it from the ground up using Vue with blog posts written using markdown. I'm pleased to say that I am starting to get my head around Vue now. I've almost had to rip up my well established process to get there but after quite a painful mindshift I am starting to see the light!

Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/peterwilmshurst/peterwilmshurst-v2).

If you haven't already, take a look at my [portfolio](/portfolio) - there's still plenty more to come! Stay tuned for the next update.
