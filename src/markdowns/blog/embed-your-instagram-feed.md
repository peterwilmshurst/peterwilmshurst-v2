# Embed your Instagram Feed 
#### 05th May, 2021

I've added a new [life](/life) page to my website. The page contains my instagram feed (mostly pictures of my kids). Those of you who know me or have taken a look through my socials will quickly realise that I tend to keep myself to myself and therefore there isn't a great deal to see! However the importance of social media and its ability to reach a large audience is unquestionable and the ability to work with APIs was something I wanted to demonstrate. 

These are the steps I followed to make this happen:

- Create a Facebook application
- Create a Facebook test app for your application
- Setup Instagram Basic Display
- Add an Instagram Test user
- Authenticate the test user
- Get an access token
- Use the token to fetch your feed

At this stage you are now able to place your instagram feed on your website I chose to do this using a Vue component. Take a look at the code by visiting the repo [here](https://github.com/peterwilmshurst/peterwilmshurst-v2).
